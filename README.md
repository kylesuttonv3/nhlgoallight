# nhlgoallight
This work in progress polls the nhl rest api for game information to determine goal scored, power play status, game over, game starting, etc for the team given as input or default San Jose Sharks. Based on the info, it plays the goal horn and light, entrance tune, power play tune, victory tune, or if team isn't playing today, sleeps until the next day.
